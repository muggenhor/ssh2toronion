Proxy to route SSH onion connections through Tor

SSH2TorOnion automatically fetches the host key for the target *.onion address,
and if its SHA-1 hash matches the onion address adds it to the user's
~/.ssh/known_hosts file. If a host key already exists it immediately continues
by providing a proxy between the SSH client and Tor (i.e. it routes the
connection through Tor).
