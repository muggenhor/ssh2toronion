SSH2TorOnion automatically fetches the host key for the target *.onion
address, and if its SHA-1 hash matches the onion address adds it to the
user's ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. If a host key already exists it immediately
continues by providing a proxy between the SSH client and Tor (i.e. it
routes the connection through Tor).
